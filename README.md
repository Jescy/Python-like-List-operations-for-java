This project is to add Java language with Python-style list features, that is list define, list slice, list comprehension, list add and multiply. 
Based on source code on Javac of OpenJDK7, after trials and errors, we come up with an original idea of adding Python-style list features to Java language. This idea is efficient, workable and stable.
